/**
 * Process-scoped registry of per-conversation generation state. Each conversation gets its own
 * [ConversationGenerationState] on first use; the entry is removed (and its scope cancelled) when
 * the conversation is deleted.
 *
 * This is the structural fix for the process-global single-slot generation state that caused
 * cross-conversation races (G2–G10): two conversations now hold independent runtime hosts,
 * resources and guidance leases, so a generation on conversation B cannot clobber conversation
 * A's UI mirror, skip A's DB persist, or get killed by A's Stop.
 *
 * The registry itself holds no generation logic — it only owns the lifecycle of the per-
 * conversation state objects. Generation entry points ([MessageGenerationController]) obtain a
 * state via [getOrCreate] and operate on it; ChatViewModel mirrors the currently-open
 * conversation's private flows into the global UI StateFlows.
