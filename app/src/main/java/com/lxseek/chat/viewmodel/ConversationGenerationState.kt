/**
 * One runtime host per conversation. It exclusively owns [runState], applies reducer transitions,
 * and coordinates the mailbox with the separately owned process resources and guidance leases, so
 * two conversations can generate in parallel without their state clobbering each other.
 *
 * Replaces the process-global single-slot generation state that predated per-conversation parallelism.
 * The global StateFlows ChatViewModel exposes to the UI are now a mirror of whichever
 * conversation is currently open (see [ConversationStateRegistry]); background conversations
 * mutate only their own private flows here and write the DB, so they stay invisible until the
 * user switches back.
 *
 * ## Ownership tokens (unchanged semantics, scoped per conversation)
 *
 *  • The resource owner's UI token owns the shared UI mirror (isLoading/streamingMessage
 *    as seen through the registry). Advanced on EVERY stop and captured by each new generation.
 *    Token-gated mutators below only touch state while their captured token is current.
 *
 *  • The resource owner's persistence token owns the model message's DB row. It advances when a
 *    new generation starts and when
 *    Stop transfers terminal-write ownership to [GenerationFinalizer], so the cancelled provider
 *    coroutine cannot race the dedicated STOPPED transaction.
 *
 * ## Slot lifecycle (requestSend / replacement compatibility / endGeneration / stop)
 *
 * Ordinary foreground Send, queued-guidance placement, and headless Task/Loop Send enter
 * [commands]' sequential mailbox port. [acquireForSend] remains only as a legacy test adapter;
 * [tryAcquireForReplacement] remains the idle-only regenerate/edit adapter. [endGeneration] and
 * [stop] submit through the same mailbox. [endGeneration] releases token-gated ownership; Stop
 * establishes the terminal cutoff, then cancels only this conversation's owned generation Job and
 * in-flight HTTP streams (via [streamScope]).
