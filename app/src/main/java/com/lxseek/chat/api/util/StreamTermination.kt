/**
 * How a streaming provider response actually ended.
 *
 * Transport EOF proves nothing on its own. A relay that closes the connection at a content-block
 * boundary leaves the socket in exactly the same state as a clean finish, which is how a
 * `tool_use` block that was about to start disappears while the text portion looks complete.
 * Completion must be proven by a SEMANTIC terminal marker: `message_stop` / `stop_reason` for
 * Anthropic, `finish_reason` / `[DONE]` for OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
 *
 * Treating HTTP 200 response headers as success — the previous behaviour — makes a mid-stream
 * truncation indistinguishable from a completed answer, so a truncated turn was persisted as a
 * successful one and the retry loop never saw it.
